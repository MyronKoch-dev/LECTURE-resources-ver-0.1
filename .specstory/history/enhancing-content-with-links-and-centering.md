## Enhancing Content with Links and Centering (2/2/2025, 9:57:16 PM)

Add links to the github and vercel references and then center all of this content in the section. If you can improve the section about pushing the button, that would be great too.

Let me check the content of the file you're referring to first.

I apologize, but I don't see the content you're referring to about GitHub and Vercel references or a section about pushing a button. Could you please:

1. Let me know which file you want to modify
2. Share the specific section you want to center and improve

This will help me make the exact changes you're looking for. The file I checked (Header.tsx) seems to be a component for displaying collection information, but doesn't contain the content you mentioned.
