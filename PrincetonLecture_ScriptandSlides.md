# AI & LLM Fundamentals: Under the Hood

<!-- _comment:
*   "Okay, we've seen the impact of AI and looked at a specific platform, Andromeda. Now, let's get a bit more technical and understand the core concepts driving these large language models."
*   "The single most important breakthrough in recent years is the **Transformer architecture**. Introduced in 2017, it revolutionized how machines process language."
-->

*   **Focus:** Understanding the Transformer and key model architectures that power today's AI.

---

# The Transformer: "Attention Is All You Need"

<!-- _comment:
*   "Before Transformers, models processed text sequentially (like RNNs or LSTMs), which struggled with long-range dependencies – understanding how words far apart in a sentence relate."
*   "The Transformer introduced the concept of **'Attention'**. Imagine the model looking at a word and asking, 'Which other words in this sentence are most relevant to understanding *this* word?' It can weigh the importance of all other words simultaneously, regardless of distance." [[Link: Attention Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
*   **(Visual Aid):** "There are fantastic visual explainers online that really help build intuition for this." [[Link: Transformer Explainer]](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/) [[Link: LLM 3D Walkthrough]](https://bbycroft.net/llm) "Highly recommend checking these out later."
*   "This parallel processing and attention mechanism is why Transformers scale so well and form the backbone of models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, etc."
-->

*   **Core Idea:** Self-Attention Mechanism allows models to weigh the importance of different words in the input text relative to each other, capturing context more effectively than sequential methods.

---

# Model Architectures: A Cheat Sheet

<!-- _comment:
*   "While most frontier models use the Transformer base, there are different 'flavors' or architectures built upon it, each with trade-offs." *(Referencing Section 2.2 Table)*
*   "You don't need to memorize all these, but understanding the Dense vs. MoE distinction is key to understanding why some models are faster or have different capabilities."
*   *(Optional: Briefly mention State-Space Models like Mamba as a non-Transformer alternative for very long context, referencing Section 2.3)* "There are also newer architectures like State-Space Models aiming for even longer context windows, but Transformers remain dominant for now."
-->

*   **Main Types:**
    *   **Dense Transformer:** Classic (GPT-3/4). All parts active. Robust but expensive.
    *   **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):** Routes tokens to specialist sub-networks (e.g., Mixtral, Gemini 1.5). High param count, cheaper compute. Complex routing.
    *   **Hybrid:** Blends Dense & MoE (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Aims for best of both.

---

# Beyond Text: Multimodal Models

<!-- _comment:
*   "While text was the initial focus, today's frontier models are increasingly **multimodal**, meaning they can understand and generate different types of data, like images, audio, and even video." *(Referencing Section 2.5 Table)*
*   "This opens up vast new possibilities for creative work, accessibility, and complex problem-solving."
-->

*   **Vision:** Models (GPT-4o, Gemini) 'see' images/screenshots/docs to answer questions, analyze charts, debug code. [[Link: GPT-4o]](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/) [[Link: Gemini]](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/)
*   **Image/Video Gen:** MidJourney (stylized images), RunwayML (image & video, e.g., Gen-4). [[Link: MidJourney]](https://www.midjourney.com) [[Link: RunwayML]](https://runwayml.com)
*   **Music Gen:** Suno, Udio create songs (vocals, instruments) from prompts. [[Link: Suno]](https://suno.com) [[Link: Udio]](https://www.udio.com)
*   **Voice Synthesis/Cloning:** ElevenLabs synthesizes speech, clones voices. [[Link: ElevenLabs]](https://elevenlabs.io/)
*   **Trend:** AI becoming general-purpose engine across modalities.

# Advanced Technique: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

<!-- _comment:
*   "Now that we understand the basics of how these models work, let's look at some advanced techniques for *using* them effectively. One of the most impactful is Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG."
*   "Think about this: LLMs are trained on vast but ultimately static datasets. They don't inherently know about *your* specific project documents, the latest company news, or real-time information."
*   **(Analogy):** "It's like giving the LLM an 'open book' exam specific to your question, rather than relying solely on its memorized knowledge."
*   **(Visual Aid):** *(Simple diagram: User Query -> Retrieval Step (finds relevant docs) -> Docs + Query -> LLM -> Grounded Answer)*
-->

*   **The Problem:** Base LLMs lack access to private/real-time data and can "hallucinate".
*   **The Solution (RAG):** First *retrieve* relevant external info, then give context + query to LLM for a grounded answer.

---

# RAG Flavors: Tailoring Knowledge Retrieval (1/2)

<!-- _comment:
*   "RAG isn't one-size-fits-all. Depending on the type of data you're working with and the kind of questions you need to answer, different RAG approaches can be more effective." *(Referencing Section 3.1 Table)*
*   "Let's look at the first few common variants:"
-->

*   **Examples:**
    *   **Plain RAG:** Simple vector search over text chunks. Good for general Q&A.
    *   **Graph RAG:** Builds/traverses a knowledge graph (code functions, story characters) before retrieval. Great for multi-step reasoning, codebases.
    *   **Hybrid RAG:** Combines keyword search (BM25) + vector search. Useful for exact terms (legal, medical).

---

# RAG Flavors: Tailoring Knowledge Retrieval (2/2)

<!-- _comment:
*   "Continuing with more RAG variants..."
*   "The key takeaway is that the 'Retrieval' part of RAG is highly customizable to best suit the knowledge source and the task."
-->

*   **More Examples:**
    *   **Hierarchical RAG:** Retrieves broad sections (chapters), then drills into sub-chunks. Ideal for long docs (textbooks, manuals).
    *   **Agentic/Tool RAG:** Retrieval step is part of an agent using other tools (calculators, APIs). Enables dynamic workflows ('lookup -> calculate').
    *   **Multimodal RAG:** Retrieves relevant images, audio, or video alongside text.

---

# Advanced Technique: Prompt Engineering 101

<!-- _comment:
*   "Beyond feeding models *context* with RAG, *how* we ask questions – the **prompt** – significantly impacts the quality and structure of the answer. This is Prompt Engineering."
*   "It's about structuring your requests to guide the LLM's reasoning process."
*   "Mastering basic prompting patterns is essential for getting the most out of any LLM."
*   **(Resource):** "For more examples, check out resources like AgentRecipes." [[Link: Prompt Chaining Primer]](https://www.agentrecipes.com/prompt-chaining)
-->

*   **Goal:** Get better, more reliable, structured outputs via careful prompting.
*   **Key Patterns** *(Ref Sec 3.2)*:
    *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Ask model to "think step-by-step" -> improves reasoning. [[Link: CoT Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)
    *   **ReAct:** Interleave reasoning & actions (tool use, search). Good for agents. [[Link: ReAct Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)
    *   **Self-Critique/Reflexion:** Prompt model to review & revise its output. [[Link: Reflexion Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366)
    *   **Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT):** Generate outline first, then elaborate. Good for writing. [[Link: SoT Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15337)

---

# How Models Are Built: The Training Pipeline

<!-- _comment:
*   "So we know how to *use* these models better with RAG and prompting, but how do they get so capable in the first place? It's typically a multi-stage process." *(Referencing Section 4.1 Table)*
*   "Understanding this pipeline helps appreciate why models behave the way they do and what goes into creating or customizing them."
*   "This pipeline transforms a raw 'next-word predictor' into the sophisticated, helpful assistants we interact with."
*   **(Visual Aid):** *(Simple diagram: Internet Data -> [Pre-training] -> Base Model -> Labeled Data -> [Fine-tuning] -> Instruction-Tuned Model -> Human Preferences -> [Alignment] -> Aligned/Helpful Model)*
-->

*   **Typical 3-Stage Pipeline:**
    *   **1. Pre-training:** Learns general language/knowledge from massive unlabeled data (trillions of tokens) via next-word prediction. Most compute-intensive.
    *   **2. Fine-tuning (SFT):** Adapts base model for specific tasks using smaller, labeled datasets (e.g., Q&A pairs, instructions). LoRA/QLoRA improve efficiency.
    *   **3. Alignment (RLHF/DPO):** Makes model helpful, harmless, honest using human feedback (RLHF) or newer methods (DPO) to guide outputs.
