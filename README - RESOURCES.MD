In about a week, these blows were cast:
- DeepSeek R1 chat model released. Blows away benchmarks, and the API costs 1/10 of chatGPT.
- Widespread press campaign claimed R1 had super-low production costs, and exhibited GPT o1 quality. 
- Result was market crash for all tech!
- R1 rumored to have Robotics training
- --> next, DeepSeek released "v3" chat model 
- Widespread press campaign claimed super-low production costs, and it exhibited GPT 4o quality. 
- --> next, "AGI BOT" demo released, claiming low production costs and "more human" movement than any competitor
- "AGI BOT" demo says DeepSeek R1 can be used in it for real-time decision making and complex problem solving 
- --> next, Alibaba announced Qwen 2.5 1M - which has a 1Mil token context window.... a direct affront to Google's Gemini models. 
- --> next, Alibaba announced Qwen 2.5-VL, which can control PCs and phones.... a direct affront to Claude's Computer Use. 

...and as a coincidence, Alibaba and Deepseek are headquartered in the same city, roughly 10-20 mins drive from each other. Probably nothing.
