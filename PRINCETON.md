## 2. AI & LLM Fundamentals

### 2.1 ⭐ Transformer Explainer And 3D LLM Walkthrough

- **⭐⭐🔭 Transformer Explainer:** [poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/){:target="_blank"}

- **⭐⭐🔭 LLM 3‑D Walkthrough:** [bbycroft.net/llm](https://bbycroft.net/llm){:target="_blank"}


### 2.2 ⭐ Model Architecture Cheat‑Sheet

🏗️ Model Architecture Cheat‑Sheet table ▸

| Architecture | Core idea | Popular 2025 examples | Strengths | Trade‑offs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dense Transformer** | Every token attends to every other via full attention; parameters fully active each step. | GPT‑4o, Llama‑3 70B, DeepSeek V3, Gemma 3 QAT | Strong generalization; mature tooling. | Expensive compute; quadratic memory. |
| **Sparse Mixture‑of‑Experts (MoE)** | Router sends each token to a small subset of expert Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) → only ~10‑25 % parameters active. | Mixtral 8×22B, OpenAI o‑series, Qwen 2.5‑1M | Higher parameter count at lower FLOPs; easy scaling. | Router complexity; load‑balancing issues. |
| **Hybrid Dense + MoE (Hierarchical)** | Alternate dense layers with MoE blocks or blend both paths. | Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro | Combines dense robustness with MoE efficiency. | Implementation complexity; tuning router‑dense balance. |
| **State‑Space Models (SSM)** | Replace attention with linear state‑space kernels (convolutional recursion). | Mamba 2.8B, S4‑X, RWKV‑5 | O(T) memory, handles >4 M tokens. | Still experimental; fewer inference libraries. |
| **Retrieval‑Augmented Autoregressive (Retro‑style)** | Decoder consults external vector DB or memory for nearest passages mid‑generation. | DeepMind RETRO, Alibaba Giraffe | Built‑in factual recall and smaller base model. | Requires datastore infra; retrieval latency. |
| **Structured Expert (GQA / MQA)** | Multi‑query or grouped‑query attention reduces KV size; acts like lightweight "expert routing." | Llama‑3, Mistral‑7B | Faster inference, smaller KV cache. | Slight accuracy trade‑off on small models. |
| **Diffusion Transformer (DiT)** | Use diffusion denoising steps with transformer backbone for images. | Stable Diffusion 3 DiT, DeepFloyd IF | High‑quality image generation. | Not suited for language tasks. |

### 2.3 ⭐ State‑Space Models (SSM) — Linear‑time Context

🔍 State‑Space Models (SSM) — Linear‑time Context ▸

SSMs replace O(N²) attention with **state‑space convolution kernels**.
* **Key idea:** hidden state hₜ evolves via linear ODE; output is causal convolution.
* **Why:** O(T) memory → streaming windows up to 4 M tokens (Mamba 2.8 B).
* **Trade‑off:** still maturing; fewer inference libraries than Transformers.

### 2.4 ⭐ Retrieval‑Augmented Transformers (RETRO‑style)

🔍 Retrieval‑Augmented Transformers (RETRO‑style) ▸

DeepMind **RETRO** mixes a decoder with a **nearest‑neighbor lookup**:

1. Chunk current hidden tokens → vector DB search
2. Fuse top‑K neighbors via cross‑attention
3. Continue autoregressive generation

Benefits = factual recall with a smaller base model.
Costs = retrieval latency & datastore infra.

### 2.5 ⭐ Model Modalities & Classes

🔍 Model Modalities table ▸

| Class | Core tasks | Canonical architectures | Signature checkpoints |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language (LLM)** | text understanding, code, reasoning | Decoder‑only Transformers; Dense / MoE / Hybrid | GPT‑4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Llama‑3 70B |
| **Vision** | classification, detection, segmentation | ViT, Swin, Mask R‑CNN | SAM, CLIP‑ViT B/16 |
| **Cross‑modal (Vision‑Language)** | image ↔ text alignment, captioning, retrieval | Dual encoders; gated fusion | CLIP | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| **Speech / Audio (ASR)** | transcription, voice control | Conformer, Transducer | Whisper (v3) |
|  | **TTS / Music Gen** | Diffusion‑decoders | Suno v3, MusicGen |
| **Diffusion / Generative Media** | images, video, 3‑D assets | Latent Diffusion, DiT | Stable Diffusion 3 | Runway Gen‑3 |
| **Graph Neural Nets (GNN)** | social‑/protein‑/traffic graphs, recommendations | GCN, GAT, GraphSage | PyG demo models |
| **Retrieval‑Augmented** | knowledge‑dense Q&A with small base LLM | Chunk retriever + Transformer decoder | DeepMind RETRO |
| **State‑Space (SSM)** | ultra‑long context seq2seq, streaming | Mamba, RWKV | Mamba‑2.8 B |
| **Reinforcement / Policy** | robotics, games, decision agents | PPO, MuZero, policy transformers | AlphaGo | Gato |

## 3. Advanced Techniques

### 3.1 ⭐ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Variants

🔍 RAG‑Variants Table ▸

| Variant | Core idea | When it shines |
|---|---|---|
| **Plain RAG** | Vector similarity search over text chunks | General chatbots & Q&A |
| **Graph RAG** | Build a knowledge graph, traverse edges, then retrieve passages | Multi‑hop reasoning, codebases |
| **Tabular / SQL RAG** | Treat rows & columns as chunks; combine SQL and embeddings | Finance, analytics, CSV‑heavy corpora |
| **Hybrid RAG** | Combine lexical BM25 with dense vectors; hybrid scoring | Legal, medical—domains with exact terms |
| **Hierarchical RAG** | Retrieve coarse sections first, then sub‑chunks | Long PDFs, textbooks, RFCs |
| **Context‑Compression RAG** | Retrieve → summarize/compress → feed to model | Token‑efficient answers on small‑ctx LLMs |
| **Agentic / Tool‑RAG** | Retrieval step wrapped inside an agent that can also call tools | Dynamic workflows e.g., "lookup → calculate" |
| **Multimodal RAG** | Index images/audio/video embeddings alongside text | Diagrams, lecture slides, podcasts |

🛠️ How Each RAG Variant Works ▸

* **Plain RAG (base‑line)** – Embed → similarity search → stuff context. General‑purpose and fast.
* **Graph RAG** – Build a knowledge graph (nodes = entities / code symbols), follow edges, then fetch passages. Excels at multi‑hop reasoning and large codebases.
* **Tabular / SQL RAG** – Treat rows & columns as chunks; combine SQL filters with vector search. Perfect for finance, analytics, and on‑chain data.
* **Hybrid RAG** – Run lexical BM25 **plus** dense‑vector search, then rank/merge. Retains exact‑term recall—great for legal or medical corpora.
* **Hierarchical RAG** – Retrieve coarse sections (chapters, headings) first, then drill into sub‑chunks. Keeps context coherent for huge PDFs or RFCs.
* **Context‑Compression RAG** – Retrieve → summarize/compress → feed to the model. Saves tokens and latency on small‑context LLMs.
* **Agentic / Tool‑RAG** – Retrieval step is wrapped inside an agent that can also invoke tools (e.g., calculators, APIs) and iterate. Enables dynamic workflows.
* **Multimodal RAG** – Index image/audio/video embeddings alongside text so the same query can pull diagrams, screenshots, or podcasts as evidence.

### 7.5 ⭐ Emerging Trends & Future Horizons

Beyond the established tools and models, several key trends are rapidly shaping the future of AI application:

*   **AI & Robotics Convergence:** The integration of advanced AI, particularly large language and vision models, into physical robots is accelerating. This includes:
    *   **Cloud-to-Robot Learning:** Training complex AI agents or specialized assistants in powerful cloud environments and then deploying the learned intelligence onto potentially less powerful edge robots.
    *   **Simulation & Digital Twins:** Creating highly realistic virtual replicas (digital twins) of robots and their operating environments (like factories). These simulations allow robots to be trained extensively on tasks, safety procedures, and collaboration *before* they are physically built or deployed, drastically speeding up development and ensuring readiness.
    *   **Autonomous Systems:** Moving beyond pre-programmed automation towards robots capable of more independent decision-making, adaptation to new situations, and complex task execution in dynamic environments (logistics, manufacturing, exploration, potentially even domestic help).

*   **AI-Generated Avatars & Digital Presence:** The ability to create highly realistic, AI-driven digital likenesses (avatars) of individuals, complete with accurate voice cloning, is rapidly advancing. Potential applications include:
    *   **Automated Meeting Attendance:** Deploying one's avatar to attend virtual meetings, take notes, summarize discussions, and even participate based on pre-defined instructions, allowing individuals to manage multiple commitments simultaneously.
    *   **Personalized Content Creation:** Generating customized video messages or educational content featuring a realistic avatar.
    *   *(Ethical considerations regarding deepfakes, identity, and consent are paramount here).*

*   **AI for Scientific Discovery:** Building on successes like AlphaFold for protein folding, AI is increasingly positioned as a "co-scientist." Tools like Google's experimental Co-scientist aim to partner with human researchers to:
    *   Analyze vast datasets to identify patterns and generate novel hypotheses.
    *   Design and optimize experiments.
    *   Control laboratory equipment and automate research workflows.
    *   Accelerate breakthroughs in fields ranging from medicine and materials science to climate modeling.

*These trends highlight a shift towards more embodied, autonomous, and deeply integrated AI systems, moving beyond purely digital assistants towards active participants in both the physical and scientific worlds.*
