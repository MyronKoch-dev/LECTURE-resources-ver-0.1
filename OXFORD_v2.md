## 🧠 Understanding AI Model Training & Model Sizes

### What Does It Mean to Train a Model?
Training an AI model involves feeding it massive amounts of text, images, or other data so it can learn patterns, relationships, and context. The process includes:
- **Pretraining:** The model learns general knowledge from large datasets.
- **Fine-tuning:** The model is adjusted for specific tasks or domains.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Additional optimization methods, like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), improve its behavior.

### What Do Model Sizes Mean?
AI models come in different sizes, typically measured in **parameters** (e.g., billions or trillions of values that help process and generate responses).
- **Base Model:** The original model trained on general data before fine-tuning for specific tasks.
- **Quantized Models:** Smaller, optimized versions of base models that reduce memory usage and improve efficiency (e.g., 4-bit or 8-bit quantization).
  - Smaller quantized models run faster and take up less space but may lose some accuracy.

## How does Retrieval Augmented Generation ("RAG") Compare to Fine-tuning? What are Graph RAG and Tab RAG?

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**Definition:**  
RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant external knowledge prior to generating responses. Rather than relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG models query databases, knowledge graphs, or document stores to obtain current or specific contextual information, significantly improving accuracy and reducing model hallucinations.


### Graph RAG
**Definition:**  
Graph RAG extends traditional RAG by structuring retrieved data as a **graph**, explicitly modeling entities, concepts, and their relationships. This structure enables context-aware retrieval, facilitates more accurate reasoning, and enhances interpretability by leveraging structured knowledge representations such as knowledge graphs, embeddings, or vector databases.


### Tabular RAG (Tab RAG)
**Definition:**  
Tab RAG specifically targets structured, tabular data sources, enabling large language models to query and integrate structured information (e.g., databases, spreadsheets, CSV files) directly into generated responses. This enhances accuracy for tasks that require precise numerical reasoning, financial analysis, data-driven decisions, or real-time querying from structured datasets.


### Key Differences

| Feature              | RAG                                   | Graph RAG                                            | Tab RAG                                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Structure**   | Unstructured text/documents           | Structured graph of entities & relationships         | Structured tabular data (tables, CSV, databases)   |
| **Retrieval Method** | Semantic search, embeddings           | Context-aware graph traversal, embeddings            | SQL queries, structured data lookups, embeddings   |
| **Use Cases**        | General knowledge retrieval, chatbots, document-based search augmentation | Scientific research, enterprise knowledge graphs, complex logical reasoning | Financial analysis, real-time data queries, structured data tasks |

## WHAT ARE AGENTS?

OpenAI defines an agent as an automated system capable of independently accomplishing tasks on behalf of users. These tasks can range from executing simple workflows to pursuing complex, open-ended objectives. Agents are built by combining various components, such as models, tools, knowledge and memory systems, guardrails, and orchestration frameworks. This modular approach enables agents to reason, make decisions, interact with their environment, and adapt to user needs

Key facets of AI agents include:

1. **Autonomy:** The ability to function without human intervention, controlling their actions and internal states independently.

2. **Reactivity:** The capacity to perceive and respond promptly to changes in the environment.

3. **Proactiveness:** The initiative to pursue goal-directed behavior by taking the necessary steps to achieve objectives.

4. **Social Ability:** The capability to interact with other agents or humans, often through communication or collaboration.

These facets enable AI agents to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple automated functions to complex decision-making processes, across various applications.

## 📢📢📢📢 AI Model Advancements - The Last Week of Shocks 📢📢📢📢

# AI Market Disruptions – A Timeline

In about a week, these blows were cast:

- **DeepSeek R1 chat model released.** Blows away benchmarks, and the API costs **1/10 of ChatGPT**.
- **Widespread press campaign claimed** R1 had **super-low production costs**, and exhibited **GPT-4o quality**.
- **Result was market crash for all tech!**
- **R1 rumored to have Robotics training**
- **→ Next, DeepSeek released "v3" chat model**
- **Widespread press campaign claimed** super-low production costs, and it exhibited **GPT-4o quality**.
- **→ Next, "AGI BOT" demo released**, claiming **low production costs** and **"more human" movement** than any competitor.
- **"AGI BOT" demo says** DeepSeek R1 **can be used in it for real-time decision making and complex problem solving.**
- **→ Next, Alibaba announced Qwen 2.5 1M** - which has a **1 million token context window**.... a **direct affront to Google's Gemini models.**
- **→ Next, Alibaba announced Qwen 2.5-VL**, which **can control PCs and phones**.... a **direct affront to Claude's Computer Use.**

...and as a coincidence, **Alibaba and DeepSeek are headquartered in the same city, roughly 10-20 mins drive from each other.**
**Probably nothing.** 🤔
