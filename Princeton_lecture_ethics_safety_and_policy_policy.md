### Notable AI Ethics & Regulatory Frameworks

- **OpenAI Preparedness Team** ‚Äì Established to benchmark and mitigate catastrophic risks from advanced AI systems, including developing monitoring systems to detect potential misuse, coordinating external red-teaming exercises, and creating technical standards to ensure safe development of increasingly capable AI. [OpenAI Safety & Security](https://openai.com/safety)

- **Anthropic RSP** ‚Äì Responsible Scaling Policy v2 (Mar 2025) implements graduated deployment protocols based on capability thresholds, requires formal safety evaluations before releasing models exceeding predefined capabilities, and establishes governance structures that can veto deployment of potentially dangerous systems. [Anthropic Responsible Scaling](https://www.anthropic.com/responsibility)

- **EU AI Act** ‚Äì Passed on 13 Mar 2025, introduces tiered compliance requirements for foundation models based on computational resources, with strict transparency and robustness requirements for high-risk systems, mandatory disclosure of AI-generated content, and significant penalties for non-compliance (up to 7% of global annual revenue). [EU AI Act Overview](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai)

- **NIST AI RMF 2.0** ‚Äì The draft (Feb 2025) introduces continuous assurance mechanisms that require regular auditing of AI systems throughout their lifecycle, integrates adversarial testing requirements, and provides sector-specific implementation paths for critical infrastructure applications including healthcare, finance, and transportation. [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)

- **U.S. Executive Order 14179 (Jan 2025):** "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence," this EO revoked the previous Biden Administration's EO 14110 ("Safe, Secure, Trustworthy AI"). It directs agencies to review and potentially rescind actions taken under EO 14110, emphasizing U.S. global AI dominance, economic competitiveness, and national security. It tasks OMB with revising AI guidance and calls for a new AI Action Plan (due mid-2025). This signals a shift away from the mandatory pre-release testing emphasis of EO 14110 towards promoting innovation.

### Global AI Governance Beyond EU/US

- **China's AI Governance Framework** ‚Äì Released Dec 2024, focuses on "managed innovation" with mandatory registration of foundation models above 100B parameters, regular audits for alignment with "core socialist values," and special governance procedures for models deployed in critical sectors. [China MIIT Guidelines](https://www.miit.gov.cn/ai-governance)

- **UAE National AI Strategy 2031** ‚Äì Establishes the world's first "AI Ministry" with a $10B investment fund, regulatory sandboxes for AI startups, and a 5-tier certification system for model deployment based on risk profiles. [UAE AI Strategy](https://ai.gov.ae/strategy/)

- **Singapore's AI Verify Foundation** ‚Äì Created Apr 2025 as the first international AI testing and certification body, providing standardized transparency reports and safety certifications for foundation models deployed across ASEAN nations. [AI Verify](https://www.aiverify.sg)

- **G7 Hiroshima AI Process** ‚Äì Multilateral framework requiring "AI impact statements" for high-risk applications, establishing the International AI Safety Laboratory with rotating leadership, and developing model capability assessment standards. [G7 Digital Ministers](https://www.g7hiroshima.go.jp/ai-process)

### Corporate Governance & Voluntary Standards

- **Frontier Model Forum** ‚Äì Consortium of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft promoting shared safety standards, red-teaming protocols, and publishing threat models and mitigation techniques. [FMF Charter](https://frontiermodel.org)

- **Partnership on AI (PAI) Responsible Scaling Pledge** ‚Äì Signed by 47 AI labs and cloud providers in Feb 2025, committing to pre-deployment adversarial testing, establishing safety teams with veto authority, and implementing capability thresholds with graduated release processes. [PAI Pledge](https://partnershiponai.org/responsible-scaling)

- **IEEE 2802-2025 Standard** ‚Äì Industry-developed technical standard for watermarking and provenance tracking of AI-generated content, with compliance certification program for model providers. [IEEE 2802](https://standards.ieee.org/ai-2802)

- **Llama Safety Alignment Playbook** ‚Äì Meta's open-source framework (Mar 2025) for safety alignment including evaluation datasets, jailbreak resistance metrics, and RLHF preference data collection guidelines used across the open model ecosystem.

<summary>‚è≥ Ethics Guidelines Timeline ‚ñ∏</summary>

### Evolution of AI Ethics Principles (2016-2025)

- **2016: Partnership on AI** ‚Äì First industry coalition (Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft) to establish ethical guidelines for AI development.

- **2018: Montreal Declaration** ‚Äì Early comprehensive framework introducing principles of well-being, autonomy, justice, privacy, knowledge, democracy, and responsibility.

- **2019: OECD AI Principles** ‚Äì Established a significant global reference point for AI policy, outlining five values-based principles for trustworthy AI (inclusive growth, human-centered values, transparency, robustness, accountability) and five recommendations for national policies. Widely adopted by member countries.

- **2021: UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI** ‚Äì First global standard-setting instrument on AI ethics, adopted by 193 member states. Addresses a broad range of issues including data governance, banning social scoring and mass surveillance, and considering environmental impacts.

- **2023: NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) 1.0 Published:** Provided a structured, voluntary framework for organizations to identify, assess, map, measure, and manage risks associated with AI systems throughout their lifecycle.

- **2024: EU AI Act Passed:** The European Union finalized its landmark AI Act, establishing the first major cross-sectoral legal framework for AI regulation based on risk levels.

- **2024 (Oct): UK AI Safety Summit (Bletchley Declaration):** First major international summit focused specifically on frontier AI risks, resulting in an agreement among 28 countries and the EU on the need for international cooperation on AI safety research and risk mitigation.

- **2025 (Expected/Ongoing): Global AI Safety Summit Accords (Seoul & Paris):** Follow-up summits building on Bletchley, aiming to establish concrete mechanisms like an international network for red teaming, interoperable capability assessment standards, and potentially a joint risk monitoring system across participating nations.
