This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, click the button below. Make sure you are logged in to your github and Vercel accounts.

## Push this button for a single-click CI/CD deployment to Vercel



#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have active accounts with [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com). If you don't have either account, please create them before proceeding.

#### One-Click Deployment


- Click the button below, 
- Then select (or add) your github account (from the Git Scope dropdown menu),
- The repo will automatically name itself 'embeddable-workshop-demo'

From there, the Vercel/Github automation will:
1. Clone this repo to your GitHub account
2. Deploy the app to Vercel with CI/CD
3. Enable automatic deployments on future pushes

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
# then
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by looking over the customization guide.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
