This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, click the button below. Make sure you are logged in to your github and Vercel accounts.

---



## Push this button for a single-click CI/CD deployment to Vercel

Pushing this button will clone the current repo into A new GitHub repo in your Github account, and then deploy the app to Vercel.
From that point forward, every time you push to the repo, Vercel will automatically deploy the app to Vercel.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
# then
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by looking over the customization guide.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
